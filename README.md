This is the updated code for CUFitness
# CUFitness

CUFitness is a Django-based web application that provides user registration, login, password reset, and profile management functionality. This project was built as a learning exercise in Django development and includes several key features.

## Features

- **User Registration:**  
  Users can register using their email and a secure password. The email is also used as the username.

- **User Login and Logout:**  
  Users can log in with their credentials. A logout button is provided on the user profile page that logs the user out and redirects to the home page.

- **User Profile:**  
  A dedicated user profile page displays the logged-in user's email and provides access to additional functionality such as logging out.

- **Password Reset:**  
  Implemented using Djangoâ€™s built-in password reset views. Users can request a password reset by entering their email, receiving instructions via email (printed to the console in development), and resetting their password using a secure link.

- **Home Page:**  
  The home page displays a motivational quote in bold and italic, centered on the page, and provides navigation links to register, log in, and access other parts of the site.
- **My Workouts**
  Workout routine for different weight classes.
